  <h3>FAQ</h3><br>
  <h5>What can SCS do for me?</h5><br>
  <ul>
  	<li><strong>Help you learn new skills.</strong> Through our tutorials, youâ€™ll encounter tools 
  	and programming languages that you may never see in your classes, such as Git, Bash and Python. 
  	These skills will help you tremendously when working on projects and looking for a job.</li>
  	<li><strong>Give you extra programming practice.</strong> Aside from a few small assignments 
  	and projects, your classes wonâ€™t give you very much practical experience. During our weekly 
  	Algorithm Time event, you can challenge yourself with fun coding problems, some of which can 
  	potentially be given to you in a real job interview. You can also participate in awesome 
  	programming competitions like CS Games and IEEEXtreme, which are not only tons of fun but 
  	give you excellent coding practice.</li>
  	<li><strong>Help you in your job hunt.</strong> Networking is extremely important when it 
  	comes to your future career. We host events like guest speakers and company tours, which 
  	will give you the opportunity to meet with representatives of different companies and build
  	your network. We also organize resume clinics.</li>
  	<li><strong>Help you make new friends and have fun!</strong> We host a number of social events
  	 throughout the year, such as Lizard Lounge, pub crawls, lan parties and wine &amp; cheese. 
  	 Youâ€™ll meet tons of really cool people and make your experience as a Concordia student 
  	 worthwhile.</li>
