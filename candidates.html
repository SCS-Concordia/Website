                                    <p>Hey! I’m Felix – you probably know me as the current president of SCS. I’d like to return to the society for my last year at Concordia in Software Engineering. </p>
                                    <p>I attended my first SCS event three years ago, became VP Academic two years ago, and became President one year ago. You can be sure that I know how the society works, I know what our key issues are, and I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t. I love SCS, and always dedicate myself fully to making the society as successful as possible! Here are some of my accomplishments this year:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Performed the VP Finance duties last summer, doubling our sponsorship money</li>
                                    	<li>Performed the VP Projects duties last fall, hosting all our weekly Algotime events</li>
                                    	<li>Filled our empty VP Finance and VP Projects positions in the fall</li>
                                    	<li>Ran one of our CSGames Tryouts in the fall</li>
                                    	<li>Organized SCS’ first participation in the ICPC Programming Competition</li>
                                    	<li>Gave all the society’s Git tutorials this winter.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>My goals for the upcoming year:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Outreach: Do more class visits to higher-year and graduate lectures</li>
                                        <li>Complete all room bookings and event information before the beginning of the semester</li>
                                        <li>Increase the frequency of SCS’ meetings to improve the team’s cohesion</li>
                                        <li>Adapt our fall activities to be online if the university remains closed</li>
                                        <li>Create strong bonds with the executive team, and with the SCS community!</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>I look forward to one more year of amazing experiences with SCS!</p>

                                    <p>I chose to apply because I strongly believe, it is time to introduce new initiatives that reflect the changes we have seen in the tech world. My main strengths are my motivation, diverse set of skills, strong leadership abilities and commitment to the betterment of SCS. </p>

                                    Hello, my name is Yasaman. I&rsquo;m a third year Software Engineering student and an aspiring leader. I hope by the end of this platform, I have provided you with enough reasons to trust me and choose me as your SCS President. Some of my previous experiences are:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Leading successful team projects for hackathons and school</li>
                                        <li>Founded Vanier tech club with some of my classmates, and received great feedbacks on the quality of organized workshops</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    My plans:<br />
                                    For the management team:<br />
                                    Plan A. Collaborate with other societies/clubs at Concordia and other universities.<br />
                                    Goal: create an opportunity for interdisciplinary projects, gain more members, and learn from the experiences of other societies/clubs.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Plan B. Weekly meetings with Vice Presidents to discuss important events, issues, ideas.<br />
                                    Goal: Enhance team communication and participation.
                                    <br/>
                                    For the members with the help of vice presidents:<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Plan A. Increase the number of motivated members.<br />
                                    Goal: to make SCS events accessible for all the students.<br />
                                    How: One step to get motivated members is to value their time and privacy.<br />
                                    How this is possible?<br />
                                    Create an agenda for members, with all the workshops/events that will be planned that semester. This will help members to have an overview of SCS events and have a better control on their time.<br />
                                    Organize workshops given by students, and faculty members. Believe it or not, student with few months of knowledge give much better workshops than professionals who worked in the field for years.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Plan B. Attract more sponsors<br />
                                    Goal: Finance our events, projects, perks, get internships<br />
                                    How: Asking companies to let us use some of their API for free in our projects. They get to advertise their products, we get to use new technologies.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    My aim is to make SCS a platform that brings together engineering students from different backgrounds and provides them a creative and friendly environment to grow and shine. I hope that you trust me to make these goals possible.

                                    Hey everyone,
                                    <br/>
                                    I'm Jun, a 4th-year SOEN student, and current VP Communications. I&rsquo;m applying to continue my role as your VP communications. I want to be a part of SCS because I want to belong to the society that brings students new and wonderful opportunities. Be it competitions, conferences, job opportunities, or friendships, SCS provides it all. I want to do my part to help this society shine.
                                    <br/>
                                    In the last year, I have worked tirelessly to promote SCS. Some things I've done include:

                                    <ul>
                                        <li >Rewriting and designing the sponsorship package for clear communication</li>
                                        <li >Designing 30+ new unique graphics, and establishing a visual identity for SCS	</li>
                                        <li >Reviving the SCS Instagram and LinkedIn accounts</li>
                                        <li >Supervising the creation of the SCS discord</li>
                                        <li >Organizing our most successful clothing sale yet, introducing 2 new colours and 3 new sizes</li>
                                        <li >Supervising the organization and promotion of Milk &amp; Cookies</li>
                                        <li >Advising logistics for the SCS Wine &amp; Cheese</li>
                                        <li >Creating infrastructure for easier room booking submissions for the SCS team</li>
                                        <li >Creating and running the SCS Elections using all of our platforms</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Many of these responsibilities do not fall under the communications umbrella. But I did them for the love of the society because I want to see SCS thrive as the amazing friendly community I know it to be.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    In the upcoming year, I plan on continuing my work, expanding the reach of SCS. I will do this by growing the communications sub-team to better balance the workload that is communications, allowing it to thrive in ways it hasn&rsquo;t been able to. And, I will continue working closely with other VPs to promote their events across all platforms, improving the society&#39;s image with high-quality graphics and clear powerful messages.
                                    <br/>
                                    For these reasons, I hope that you will allow me to be your VP Communications once again.
                                    <br/>
                                    Thank you

                                    <p>
                                    Hello, my name is Jeffrey and I am a second-year undergraduate student enrolled in Computer Science Co-op.  Currently, I have a strong interest and appreciation towards 3D modeling for medical purposes as well as Web design. Furthermore, my experience as VP Academic for UAV Concordia (a super cool drone club) has allowed me to organize fun and insightful events for fellow engineers! People generally describe me as someone who is joyful, caring and creative. 😊
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Goals</h5>
                                    <p>
                                    As an undergraduate who has had many great experiences with SCS events previously, my goal for this position is to first and foremost serve as the bridge between SCS and the students of Concordia University. In fact, welcoming individuals and hosting events are responsibilities I am very familiar with and love to do due to my time at UAV Concordia. VP Communications to me is making sure everyone in the community is aware of all the amazing opportunities open to them and promote self-growth and cooperation through these experiences. Indeed, my objective is to make sure that people are joining all the events they consider right for them, even the ones they never would have thought to be interesting!
                                    </p>
                                    Additionally, here are my ideas for potential events I would encourage:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Intro to Web Development and Design 🖼🎨</li>
                                        <li>How to write proper emails 📧</li>
                                        <li>Speed job interview sessions 🤵</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>In hopes of keeping this community strong during these uncertain times.</p>

                                    Hi, this is Laila! I’m a second-year computer science student. A little about me: I’ve always had a strange combination of interests: full-stack development, Haikyuu! and HxH, cheesy rom-coms, and binging friends. It is also not a secret that I’ve admired SCS’s work and events since I started at Concordia. The attitude of the team and the quality of the workshops have always made it so fun to attend. I’ve been wanting to join a community since my first year and I’d be honored to work alongside such a cool team. I’m excited to get involved and hopefully bring great newsletters and updates that get you excited for upcoming events. I’ve volunteered at WIE which has really strengthened my communication skills. I also love working with Figma so I’ll do my best to bring fun designs to the promotions. I’m an avid reader so my writing isn’t half bad. To sum it up, I’ll try my best to add a little spice to the role!

                                        Hi there! My name is Jose Fernandez, and I'm running for the VP Internal position with SCS. 
                                    </p><p>Having just finished my first year at Concordia in Computer Science, I can proudly say that SCS helped me stand out by encouraging me to try new things such as going to competitions. I want SCS to remain a solid source of encouragement and support for students, both new and returning, and I am confident I can do that for the society and it's community as a part of the executive team. 
                                    </p><p>After spending time with SCS as a First Year Representative, I have a good idea of what it takes, and I've prepared myself to dedicate more time to the society. As VP Internal, I'll assure that the new team builds good chemistry and stays organized so as to allow SCS to focus on the community as a whole and have a good time doing so!  
                                    </p>

                                        <em>First Choice</em> <br/>
                                        I am Roshleen Mand and I am running for the elections as VP Internal/Finance of SCS as for the academic year 2020-2021. I will be entering my third year as a Computer Engineering major who aims towards hacking productivity and am always down for new challenges. I am good at time management, innovative and dynamic. In my second year, I got exposure to many societies including SCS, Space Concordia, McGill Trading as well as Debating Society and have significantly volunteered at Frosh 2019 , people’s potatoes as well as technology sandbox. I have also worked with ""Engineeius"" conducting workshops to teach basics of coding and building.  I love doing research about stock-market trading including fundamental investment strategies to make trades.
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>Realising the volatility in the technology sector, I would bring forward the idea to have <b>“SCS - Concordia Students PODCAST”</b> to let the voice of our sponsors and industrialists, working through changing trends, reach all students. 
                                        </li><li>I encourage the need to have workshops like intro to cloud or ubiquitous computing or maybe introducing basics of encryption algorithms to Algo’s time. Providing students what they can't expect in classes will be a huge boon to the society.
                                        </li><li>I strongly believe that greater emphasis on projects and competitions will only give our society an edge over others, making it the BEST! Tenaciously working towards promoting the society, I will try my best to work hard with VP Projects and Competitions to help achieve the same. 
                                        </li></ul>
                                        The reason why I specifically choose to be VP Internal is because it is rightly said “United we stand, divided we fall!”  and I do realise the importance of internal communication to help achieve a common goal i.e, facilitating innovation, promoting and ensuring commitment to our society. As executive member, I will try to ensure more recruitments, fulfill all requirements including booking rooms and organising meetings and events.

                                        Hello SCS! 
                                    </p><p>My name is Matthew Pan and I'm running for the VP Internal position.
                                    </p><p> I got acquainted with SCS through events such as Git Tutorials and Algotime, and since then had an interest to join the club because I thought the workshops were well-made and I there's a lot I could learn from from just the few people I have met from SCS so far. More importantly, I would love to get to meet more people of the community. I also worked as a journalist intern towards the end of my Cegep years where I had to deal with logistical affairs and organize schedules, which I believe is an experience that made me a more organized person. Thus, I chose the VP Internal role as I would love to help handle the internal matters of the society and keep the office in order for you. </p><p>Thanks for reading this and happy voting! :)

                                        <p>Hello, fellow Concordians! My name is Peter Delis and I am running to be your SCS VP Internal! 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Over the past year, I have been super involved with SCS as the SOEN first year representative organizing, and setting up events for everyone to learn, chill and have a good time. 
                                        Being part of SCS early on has allowed me to understand all the inner workings of the society and how we function. 
                                        From assisting at our tutorials, to serving up some delicious milk and cookies before finals, I’ve been an active member of the society and hope to contribute even more as VP Internal.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        In this position, I would be responsible for booking rooms and keeping track of important information for SCS.
                                        It is important for Internal to be on top of things and remain reliable throughout the semester.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I think I am the right person for the job because of my experience with multiple ECA societies while maintaining an excellent academic standing. 
                                        I believe this speaks to my strong time-management and organisational skills which is important for any executive joining the team.
                                        More specifically for VP Internal, my involvement in the executive of societies like SCS and EngGames has enabled me to understand this role from different perspectives.
                                        Therefore, I can bring a more refined and efficient take on the position.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I would like to thank all of you in advance for considering my candidacy for VP Internal. 
                                    </p><p>
                                        I love SCS and what we are about and I look forward to growing our society in the future!

                                        I am Roshleen Mand and I am running for the elections as VP Internal/Finance of SCS as for the academic year 2020-2021. I will be entering my third year as a Computer Engineering major who aims towards hacking productivity and am always down for new challenges. I am good at time management, innovative and dynamic. In my second year, I got exposure to many societies including SCS, Space Concordia, McGill Trading as well as Debating Society and have significantly volunteered at Frosh 2019 , people’s potatoes as well as technology sandbox. I have also worked with ""Engineeius"" conducting workshops to teach basics of coding and building.  I love doing research about stock-market trading including fundamental investment strategies to make trades.
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>Realising the volatility in the technology sector, I would bring forward the idea to have <b>“SCS - Concordia Students PODCAST”</b> to let the voice of our sponsors and industrialists, working through changing trends, reach all students. 
                                        </li><li>I encourage the need to have workshops like intro to cloud or ubiquitous computing or maybe introducing basics of encryption algorithms to Algo’s time. Providing students what they can't expect in classes will be a huge boon to the society.
                                        </li><li>I strongly believe that greater emphasis on projects and competitions will only give our society an edge over others, making it the BEST! Tenaciously working towards promoting the society, I will try my best to work hard with VP Projects and Competitions to help achieve the same. 
                                        </li></ul>
                                        My second priority is VP Finance. As a VP Finance, I will ensure transparency in the spendings and try to maintain the budget while implementing society’s requirements. I will have an optimistic and cordial attitude towards team members and sponsors and would definitely seek advice from team members to come up with best funding strategies. I vow to present a detailed and transparent annual budget report to the ECA council.

                                    Hi,<br/>

                                    I'm a 3rd-year student in Computer Engineering and applying for the post of VP Academics.<br/>
                                    
                                    During my first year, I went to most of the SCS and IEEE tutorials. This gave me some advantage in terms of knowledge and meeting other experienced students. Due to this, I knew how and where to apply for internships and how to tackle new hobbies.
                                    <br/>
                                    This leads me to apply for this post because I want to give back to others(I also like teaching).
                                    <br/>
                                    About me:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Luckily, I have plenty of friends or acquaintances in various fields of tech & science that are smarter than me. Thus, it allows me to invite them to teach.</li>
                                        <li>Hobbyist: Audio, video, embedded systems(i.e: robotics), some ethical hacking & machine learning</li>
                                        <li>More hobbies: painting and video games</li>
                                        <li>Use to work as an Eng. Technician</li>
                                        <li>Use to be enrolled in the Forces</li>
                                        <li>Loves to teach</li>
                                        <li>Organized</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    My Program for 2020-2021:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>(Guaranteed)Maintain current popular tutorials(i.e: intro to git,intro to unity)
                                      Would prefer to introduce a more intuitive teaching method (inspired by CodingTrain's git 
                                      tutorial)</li>
                                      <li>(Planning) Additional tutorials from various field:
                                            <ul>
                                              <li>(Might need to invite a friend who's a researcher)Hands-On Machine Learning(none of that deep theory stuff that everyone forgets)-directly work with libraries and real data</li>
                                              <li>Embedded Systems: Although this is a vast field, we can introduce basic hardware tutorials and collaborate with IEEE & Space Concordia</li>
                                              <li>Deeper Unity Tutorials in collaboration with Concordia Game Devs Club(they know their Unity)</li>
                                            </ul>
                                      </li>
                                      <li>(Optional) Crash courses for common Comp.Sci/SOEN/COEN/ELEC courses.</li>


                                    </ul>
                                    In summary, the academic program simply adds more tutorials. It looks to integrate other student clubs which can help expose students to new careers/hobbies/projects.

                                    Hello people of SCS, my name is Matthew Pan and I would like to serve as your VP Academic! I first got into contact with SCS during a Git Tutorial, and since then, I had an interest to join the club. I found the workshop super useful as what I learned from it directly came in handy when I had to use GitHub during a Hackathon shortly after. I would like to join SCS because of how well I deemed the workshops were coordinated, to get involved to help others & meet new people, and because I could imagine myself working with the few people I have met from SCS so far. Other events I have attended are the iOS workshop and Algotime, and although I wasn’t able to solve much questions in the latter… It was definitely fun to have others help me! Now, I chose the academic role because I really did enjoy the workshops I went to and think it would be fun to organize them and help others. I believe I am also an organized person so I should deal well with logistical issues/emails, and I spend a lot of time on my studies so you can be sure I have decent grades. Finally, as I enjoy teaching, I would love to give tutorials myself once I deem myself qualified enough to do so. Although I am still new and haven't met a lot of you, I hope to get to know you all in the upcoming year. Thanks for reading this and happy voting! :)

                                    Hello, my name is Yasaman. I’m a third year Software Engineering student and an aspiring leader and instructor. I hope by the end of this platform, I have provided you with enough reasons to trust me and choose me as your SCS VP academics. Some of my previous experiences are:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Organized programming tutorials for my non comp sci friends</li>
                                        <li>Founded Vanier tech club with some of my classmates and received great feedbacks on the quality of organized workshops</li>
                                        <li>Volunteered as Math, Science, and computer science Tutor at Vanier College. Nominated for tutor excellence award by my tutees. Got Selected for summer school tutoring.</li>
                                    </ol>    
                                    
                                    Let’s get to my plans to improve SCS:
                                    Plan A. Increase the number of motivated members. 
                                    Goal: to make SCS events accessible for all the students.
                                    How: Organizing quality workshops and events. 
                                    How this is possible?
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Create an agenda for members, with all the workshops/events that will be planned that semester. This will help members to have an overview of SCS events and manage their time better.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Organize workshops given by students, and faculty members. It’s hard to get workshops by sponsors, and most of the time, these workshops lack comprehension and quality for beginners. Believe it or not, student with few months of knowledge give much better workshops than professionals who worked in the field for years. Also, we can ask Concordia professors to give workshops if they are interested. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Organize workshops in series. Breaking down the subject in smaller workshop series makes the workshop easier to follow and understand.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Organize pre-recorded and online workshops. This is a great solution for students who are tight in time, or unable to attend the workshops in person. 
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    My aim is to make SCS a platform that empowers engineering students by giving them the skills and knowledge they need in the work field. I hope that you trust me to make these goals possible.

                                        CS has always been a passion of mine. I have been programming since childhood and as a result, I’ve gained experience in several areas of CS. I believe I can play a key role in the SCS team. I’ve participated in SCS competitions as well as in CTFs, competitive programming, and hackathons. I also have a passion for teaching. Most recently, I’ve introduced SCS Community members to hacking. By joining the team, I hope to make competitions fun and challenging!

                                    Hi there! My name is Jose Fernandez, and I'm running for the VP Projects position with SCS. Having just finished my first year at Concordia in Computer Science, I can proudly say that SCS helped me stand out by encouraging me to try new things such as going to competitions. I want SCS to remain a solid source of encouragement and support for students, both new and returning, and I am confident I can do that for the society and it's community as a part of the executive team. After spending time with SCS as a First Year Representative, I have a good idea of what it takes, and I've prepared myself to dedicate more time to the society. I've always been one to take on challenges, and as VP Projects, I'll make sure to empower the SCS community to follow their ideas and make them grow. Ideally, I'll also help SCS go even further than ever before with new project ideas. There is no better feeling than overcoming a good challenge, and I'll be there to support our innovators and geniuses in getting there!

                                    <p>"One of the most empowering feelings in the world of software development is finally deploying that project that you’ve created from scratch, with nothing more than a few laptops and some friends. As VP of Projects, it is my goal to put students in the best possible position to collaborate with others so they have the opportunities to bring their wildest programming ideas to life. 

                                    </p><p> first goal will to be to organize coding nights, in person and remotely, where students can come together and help each other on any projects they are working on. I will specifically look to have shorter, more laid-back, but still very much programming driven coding sessions in order to welcome programmers of all skill levels. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and it’s the small, incremental progress which allows students to continually improve their programming abilities in the long-term. Make project-making approachable, and get as many people creating things with code as possible, that is the plan.

                                    </p><p>But of course… everybody loves a good Hackathon. The coronavirus has been tough, and finding things to do during the long days can definitely be tougher. As a result, as your VP of Projects, I will be organizing multiple remote hackathons throughout these summer months. We all need some socialization right now, and what better way to do so while hacking some code together with your friends. 


                                    </p><p>THIS IS MY SECOND CHOICE, FIRST BEING VP SOCIAL, THANKS!"</p>

                                    “You want a job at FAAMG? Then improve your coding skills aka your algorithms.”<br/>
                                    Well that looks pretty simple right? Do some leetcode questions and get a job at Google. But, the problem is data structures and algorithms aren’t that easy to tackle especially if you are a beginner.

                                    <p>In the beginning, people are very prone on getting lost while doing a question. From my own personal experience, it’s tough to actually know which algorithm would work and how to apply it considering the edges cases. So, I feel the best way to do such questions are when you are initially given a head-start, means you know which data-structure to use or which algorithm to start with.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    Hence, if I am elected as the VP of projects, I would make algotime more interactive, along with giving coding questions to solve, my main objective is to walk you guys around on how to tackle such questions, how think about a particular question, how to identify which algorithm would work and which test cases we need to take care of.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                    My goal as VP of projects is not to conduct weekly coding competitions where the best would win. My goal is to make the beginners better at “competitive programming”. </p>

                                    Hi there! My name is Jose Fernandez, and I'm running for the VP Social position with SCS. Having just finished my first year at Concordia in Computer Science, I can proudly say that SCS helped me stand out by encouraging me to try new things such as going to competitions. I want SCS to remain a solid source of encouragement and support for students, both new and returning, and I am confident I can do that for the society and it's community as a part of the executive team. After spending time with SCS as a First Year Representative, I have a good idea of what it takes, and I've prepared myself to dedicate more time to the society. My goal as VP Social goes two ways. I want to challenge myself with tasks I'm not so familiar with, and I also want to provide a balanced learning experience for the SCS community. A wise person definitely once said that half the value of the journey is the people you meet along the way. When it's not time to code, I'll make sure our people have a blast forgetting the weight of classes we all carry, together!

                                    <em>First Choice</em>
                                    <p>
                                        Everybody has heard the old adage “your network is your net worth”, well I have my own; “partying is the single best way to get LinkedIn connections”. My name is Andrew Rover, and as your VP of Social, I promise to make networking fun and easy, providing SCS students with the best opportunities to both get to know each other, as well as leading contacts in the software industry.
                                        As VP of social, I promise to create a schedule of diverse social events that suits a variety of preferences. Firstly, I will look to organize pub crawls and power hours. Small entrance fee, unlimited beer and socializing opportunities. More of a fan of talking programming and vibing? I will also look to create lounge get-togethers where SCS students can hang out and talk about anything they like, coding, their pass-times (machine learning), and anything in-between.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Furthermore, on top of organizing networking events with top software companies in attendance, I know that getting an interview is just half the challenge to landing that dream internship. To aid students in their preparation for the coding interview, I will be organizing meet-ups on Pramp, a website specifically made for people to mock interview each other in preparation for coding interviews. This allows students both to get to know others in their program, as well as sharpening their technical (and behavioural!) interview skills.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Lastly, despite the start of the new academic year being a ways away, coronavirus may very well still be a part of daily life by then. As such, I will look to be proactive and have virtual alternatives to any social event. So yes, if we can’t frosh, virtual beer pong will be a thing, and we’ll make it great.
