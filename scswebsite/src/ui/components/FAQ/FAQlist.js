          <h2>How/Where can I order hoodie or a sweater?</h2>
          <Typography>
            We usually have a sale at the beginning of the Fall semester and another one at the beginning of
            the Winter semester. \n
            You can try out the different sizes at our booth during the sale period and pay at the ECA office on the 8th floor.

          <h2>How long does it take to receive my clothing order??</h2>
          <Typography>
            Since each order is custom made, it takes around 3-4 weeks to receive the order after the end of the sale period.

          <h2>Can I get a refund/exchange?</h2>
          <Typography>
            Unfortunately, since it is custom made per order form we cannot do any exchanges or returns
